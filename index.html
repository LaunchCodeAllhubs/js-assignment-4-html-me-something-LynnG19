         <h2>How It Started</h1>
         <p id="testP">I was about 10 years old when I was trying to find something on tv to watch.  I found a baseball game taking place.  It was the Atlanta Braves losing very badly against another team, yet my attention stayed.  I ended up watching more games and becoming a fan.  As I got older I wanted to travel to Atlanta to watch a game in person but other things became a priority. I never put time aside. So, in 2001 it was announced that the Montreal Expos were going to leave Montreal for good <i>(reasons I don’t remember)</i>. They ended up relocating to Washington D.C. and called the Nationals.</p>

         <h3> Decisions Were Made</h2>
         <p>I decided that this was my opportunity to see Atlanta play as an opposing team in Montreal.  I was born and raised in Buffalo, NY so driving wasn’t a big deal with it being an 8 hour drive. They were coming to play Montreal in May and so I bought tickets and reserved a hotel. I felt it wasn&apos;t a huge commitment compared to flying or driving to Atlanta at that time.</p>

         <h4>Montreal Itself</h3>
         
          <p>May came around and I drove there.  I stopped along the way to see the Thousand Islands and arrived the day before the game.  Since it was an evening game I decided to leave my car at the hotel and check out some of the shops nearby.  I utilized their bus system to go to the botanical gardens for their bonsai tree section. Then proceeded to the game which wasn’t that far away.  The game was pretty good and after leaving I took the train that was located beneath the stadium back to the hotel.  I really enjoyed the short time I had there even though it was baseball related, I came back next year when it was a little warmer.  That time I actually went to Montreal and Quebec City. </p>
